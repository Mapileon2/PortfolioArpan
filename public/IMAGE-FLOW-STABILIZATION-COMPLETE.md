URL Validation ‚Üí Supabase Storage ‚Üí Progress Tracking ‚Üí Completion
```

### Fallback System Hierarchy
1. **Original Image URL** - Primary image source
2. **Cached Version** - Previously loaded image from cache
3. **Retry Attempt** - Automatic retry for failed loads
4. **Context Fallback** - Appropriate fallback for the context
5. **Default Placeholder** - Final fallback with generated placeholder

### Async Loading Process
1. **Cache Check** - Look for previously loaded image
2. **Race Condition Check** - Prevent duplicate loading requests
3. **Loading State** - Set loading indicators and progress tracking
4. **Timeout Protection** - Prevent hanging requests
5. **Error Recovery** - Retry logic with exponential backoff
6. **Fallback Handling** - Use appropriate fallback on failure
