**Key Changes:**
- Implemented atomic upsert operations with conflict resolution
- Added optimistic locking using version timestamps
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
- Added automatic re-fetch after successful operations

**Before:**
```javascript
// Original problematic save logic
async function saveCase Study(data) {
    const result = await supabase.from('case_studies').insert(data);
    return result; // No error handling, no re-fetch
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Enhanced persistence with comprehensive error handling
async function saveCase Study(data, options = {}) {
    return await persistenceFix.upsertCaseStudy(data, {
        conflictResolution: 'merge',
        optimisticLocking: true,
        autoRefetch: true,
        ...options
    });
}
```

### 8.2 Enhanced Case Study Service

async function updateCaseStudy(id, data) {
    const result = await saasService.updateCaseStudy(id, data);
    return result;
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Enhanced save with comprehensive feedback
async function updateCaseStudy(id, data, options = {}) {
    const { showLoading = true, autoRefetch = true } = options;
    
    if (showLoading) {
        this.notifySaveStateChange('saving', 'Updating case study...');
    }
    
    const result = await this.baseService.updateCaseStudy(id, data);
    
    if (autoRefetch) {
        const verified = await this.refetchCaseStudy(id);
        result.verified = verified;
    }
    
    if (showLoading) {
        this.notifySaveStateChange('success', 'Case study updated successfully');
    }
    
    return result;
