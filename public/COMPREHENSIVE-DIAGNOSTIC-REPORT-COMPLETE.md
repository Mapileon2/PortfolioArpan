## Cross-Analysis Correlations

### Data Persistence â†” Schema Issues
- Missing RLS policies compound persistence failures
- Schema inconsistencies create deployment risks
- Missing audit trails prevent proper debugging

### Image Handling â†” Code Duplication
- 6 duplicate upload implementations increase failure points
- Missing centralized error handling
- Inconsistent validation across services

### API Issues â†” Error Handling
- 17 unprotected routes create crash risks
- 71 unhandled promises cause silent failures
- Missing validation enables data corruption

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- âœ… Case studies update reliably 100% of time
- âœ… All security vulnerabilities resolved
- âœ… Images upload and display consistently
