# ✅ Preview Issue Fixed!

## 🐛 **Root Cause Identified**

**Error**: `TypeError: reflection.learnings.map is not a function`

**Problem**: The display page was trying to use `.map()` on data that wasn't an array, causing the preview to crash during rendering.

---

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Issue**: Array Method Errors
The render functions were assuming certain data properties were arrays without checking:

```javascript
// BEFORE (Caused Error)
reflection.learnings.map(learning => ...)  // ❌ learnings might not be array

// AFTER (Fixed)
reflection.learnings && Array.isArray(reflection.learnings) && reflection.learnings.length > 0
```

### **Fixed Functions**:
- ✅ `renderReflectionSection()` - Added array check for `learnings`
- ✅ `renderOverviewSection()` - Added array check for `metrics`
- ✅ `renderProcessSection()` - Added array check for `steps`
- ✅ `renderSolutionSection()` - Added array check for `features`
- ✅ `renderShowcaseSection()` - Added array check for `images`
- ✅ `renderGallerySection()` - Added array check for `images`
