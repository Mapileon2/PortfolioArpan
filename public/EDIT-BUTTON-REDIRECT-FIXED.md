# ✅ Edit Button Redirect Fixed!

## 🐛 **Issue**: Wrong Editor Redirect

**Problem**: Edit button in preview was redirecting to:
```
❌ http://localhost:3013/case_study_editor_enhanced.html?id=preview-123
```

**Should redirect to**:
```
✅ http://localhost:3013/case_study_editor_complete.html
```

---

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Before**:
```javascript
// Always redirected to enhanced editor
window.location.href = `/case_study_editor_enhanced.html?id=${this.caseStudyId}`;
```

### **After**:
```javascript
// Smart redirect based on context
if (this.caseStudy && this.caseStudy.isPreview) {
    // Preview mode: go to complete editor (no ID needed)
    window.location.href = `case_study_editor_complete.html`;
} else {
    // Regular mode: go to complete editor with ID
    window.location.href = `case_study_editor_complete.html?id=${this.caseStudyId}`;
}
```

## ✅ **Expected Behavior Now**

### **From Preview Mode**:
1. User clicks **Edit** button in preview
2. Redirects to: `case_study_editor_complete.html`
3. Opens the complete editor with all features
4. User can continue editing with same functionality

### **From Regular Case Study**:
1. User clicks **Edit** button in published case study
2. Redirects to: `case_study_editor_complete.html?id=123`
3. Loads the specific case study for editing
