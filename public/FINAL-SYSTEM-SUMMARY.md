## 🚀 **KEY ACHIEVEMENTS**

### **✅ MAJOR ISSUES RESOLVED**

#### **1. Carousel Homepage Sync Issue** 🎠
- **Problem**: Carousel images uploaded in admin not appearing on homepage
- **Root Cause**: Missing sync script and Swiper initialization conflicts
- **Solution**: Created `js/homepage-carousel-sync.js` and real-time DOM manipulation
- **Result**: ✅ Carousel images now sync instantly from admin to homepage

#### **2. Case Study Data Format Mismatch** 📊
- **Problem**: Case studies showing as "Untitled Project" on homepage
- **Root Cause**: API returns snake_case but homepage expects camelCase
- **Solution**: Data normalization in `script.js` with fallback logic
- **Result**: ✅ Case studies now display proper titles and content

#### **3. Broken "Read Story" Links** 🔗
- **Problem**: "Read Story" links showing "Oops! Something went wrong"
- **Root Cause**: Links pointing to wrong file with wrong parameters
- **Solution**: Fixed all links to use `case_study_display.html?id=`
- **Result**: ✅ All case study links now work perfectly
